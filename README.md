Terraform Projects – Azure Infrastructure

This repository contains a collection of Terraform projects focused on designing and deploying
Microsoft Azure infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices.

Each project demonstrates a real-world cloud architecture pattern and can be used for learning,
reference, and portfolio purposes.

📌 Project 1: Azure Hub-and-Spoke Architecture
🔹 Overview

This project implements a Hub-and-Spoke network architecture in Azure using Terraform.
The hub virtual network provides centralized connectivity and security using Azure Firewall,
while the spoke virtual network hosts application workloads.
